# Monmouth County Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict commercial property sale prices in Monmouth County. The model is built using Python and various libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, pyspark) and is deployed as a real-time endpoint using Amazon SageMaker. The repository includes all code for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

- **data/**: Contains the raw CSV file with property data.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data processing, model training, scaling, and deployment.

## Environment Setup
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11
- **Required Packages:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
  - pyspark
  - matplotlib
  - git-lfs (if using Git LFS for large files)
- **Installation:**  
  Install the required packages using:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  (Ensure you include a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies.)

## Instructions for Running the Notebooks
### Locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TJC1996/Monmouth-County-Final.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebooks (located in the `notebooks` folder) in your preferred Jupyter environment.

### In Amazon SageMaker Studio:
1. Open SageMaker Studio and connect to your environment.
2. Clone the repository into your SageMaker Studio workspace.
3. Open the notebooks in JupyterLab within SageMaker Studio.

## Deployment Details
The model is deployed using Amazon SageMaker endpoints. The deployment pipeline includes:
- **Data Pipeline:** Data is cleaned and processed in the notebooks.
- **Model Training:** The model is trained and evaluated in the notebooks.
- **Deployment:** The trained model is packaged and deployed as a real-time endpoint using the SageMaker Python SDK.

Example code for deployment:
```python
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.model import Model

sagemaker_session = sagemaker.Session()
role = "arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:role/<your_sagemaker_role>"
model_artifact = "s3://<your_bucket>/path/to/model.tar.gz"
container_image_uri = "<your_ecr_image_uri>"

model = Model(
    image_uri=container_image_uri,
    model_data=model_artifact,
    role=role,
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session
)

predictor = model.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.xlarge",
    endpoint_name="monmouth-county-realestate-endpoint"
)
```

## Logging and Data Pipeline
- **Data Pipeline:** The notebooks include code for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- **Logging:** Key metrics (e.g., RMSE, R², training time) are logged to the console. For production, you can integrate with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring endpoint performance.

## API / UI (Optional)
If you choose to build an API (e.g., using Flask) to query your deployed model:
- Place your API code in a `src/` folder.
- Include a `Dockerfile` if you plan to containerize your API.
- Document how to query your endpoint (using Python, Postman, or curl) in this README.

Example API snippet:
```python
import requests

endpoint_url = "https://<your_endpoint>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod"
data = {"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}
response = requests.post(endpoint_url, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

## Troubleshooting / FAQ
- **CSV Header Issues:** If you encounter CSV header mismatches, ensure you explicitly select and rename columns in your notebooks.
- **Environment Variables:** Set any required environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME) as needed.
- **Endpoint Issues:** Check Amazon CloudWatch logs for any errors if your endpoint is not responding.

## Final Notes
- Test the entire workflow in SageMaker Studio to ensure the endpoint is “InService” and returns accurate predictions.
- Make sure all instructions in this README work as expected.
